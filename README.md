# Secret Santa Generator

Secret Santa Generator is a simple CLI script that generates the Secret Santa's couples for you.
Once you've added all the participants, their email, and optionally a propic and some ideas, it will
send and email to each one of them, with the extracted gift-receiver.

See [howto.md](howto.md) for the instructions.
